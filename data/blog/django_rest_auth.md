I tried to use a lots of django packages to find a good one to quick build web api backend but I did not find a good enough one. I found this one: drf-user and it is good but I try to make it meet my requirements so I built another one based it.

You can get it from my github repo for now. I still do some works like make docs, add comments, etc. And there're some features still in progress for now.
